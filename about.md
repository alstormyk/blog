*  A blog exploring my passion of making upcycled clothing, coding, and design.

Right now this blog is a little bit dull. I've only just started this business. The webshop is still a work in progress as are the handmade items I plan to sell.

This site is made with a Jekyll theme I made named Conscious Sedation. This was done on my old Lenovo Ultrabook Ideapad held together with Hello Kitty washi tape. It's running a flavor of Debian called BunsenLabs. I used the new Microsoft text editor VScode and I loved it. I have been a fan of Atom for some time, but it freezes up my laptop.

I'm a Californian living in the Netherlands with my Dutch husband (a maths teacher). We have two female cats, one brought from the US and one adopted locally.
